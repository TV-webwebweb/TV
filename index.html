  <h1>THE TV WEBSITE</h1>
  <p> Hello! I just released an EP on the 17th of October. It's called Polar and this <a href=https://ditto.fm/polar-tv>link</a> takes ya straight to it. 
     <p> This next link (click <a href=https://ditto.fm/polar-tv>here</a> ) takes you to a file containing 3 demos i made after this ^^ EP. They were made intentionally more lo fi and fun maybe...
      also on this link is a weird as SAMPLE PACK (or select fraction of) i made over the course of last year. please download and use at ur leisure, theres some wacky shit on there.
